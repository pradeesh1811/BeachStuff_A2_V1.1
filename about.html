 <h2> A Little Story About Us </h2> 
 <p>
  This whole adventure started in 2012 with a tiny shop lovingly built with the help of family <br>& friends in an amazing community. After over a decade of working in the fashion industry I <br>decided to leave the city and look for a more meaningful lifestyle. California and it's waves <br>have stolen my heart and I've never looked back!


  Everything we carry in the shop represents<br> my interpretation of the Golden State. Sun, beaches, parties, and nostalgic - things <br>you might find at a party city.
